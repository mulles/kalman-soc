# kalman-soc

Fork of Okra's lightweight embedded state of charge (SOC) algorithm based on extend kalman filter (EKF). 

## Usage (Linux) 
   
## Build 
   ```
   #Install requirements
     sudo apt install meson ninja-build build-essential clang-format cmake  
   
   #Git clone this repository with `--recursive` option:  
     git clone --recursive git@github.com:mulles/kalman-soc.git  
     #or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after normal clone.

   #Setup build directory  
    cd kalman-soc  
    meson setup build

   #Build with ninja
    cd build  
    ninja  

   #Run unit tests
    ./run_tests   


```

## Run backtests

Backtest a dataset of current and voltage measurements you recorded in the past by running: 

   `./backtest`  
   
A test dataset is located in `/data` and consist of `raw_sensor_data.csv` and `node_data.csv` as input data. 
- `node_data.csv` (contains 0-1 columns. Column[0] = boolean (lithium[true] or lead[false]) Column[1] = 12 (battery system voltage) )
- `raw_sensor_data.csv` (contains 0-4 columns)
- `example_processed_sensor_data.csv` (contains the input raw sensor data and the calculated SOC in column 5, it is generated by the backtest and named   `processed_sensor_data.csv`)

On successful run, output on the command line should be: 
```
Finished reading.
Finished writing.
```
The output file should be the same as `example_processed_sensor_data.csv` and is named `processed_sensor_data.csv`.
